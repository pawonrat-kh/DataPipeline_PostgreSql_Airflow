# DataPipeline_PostSql_Airflow

Hello, My name is Pawanrat Khumgoen. In this repository, I will show and walk through my project, which is a data pipeline. In this project, I developed a data pipeline using a case from previous work about getting files from One Drive and transferring them to Google storage. 

After I researched and learned more data engineer skills from Coursera, I am using this knowledge composed of Data modeling, Data pipeline, Databases, Shell scripting, and Apache Airflow to design and create data pipeline simulation.
